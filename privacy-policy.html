  <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>I do not collect or store any personal information on servers.</strong> Any data such as in-game names you enter is saved locally in your browser's <strong>localStorage</strong>. This data stays on your device and is not transmitted to me or any third parties.</p>
  <p><strong>I do not use backend servers or databases</strong> to collect or store your personal information.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of DNS and Hosting Services</h2>
  <p>I use <strong>Cloudflare</strong> as my DNS provider and <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> to host my websites. These services may collect minimal technical data as part of their normal operation, but <strong>I do not have access to any personal data</strong> collected by them.</p>
  <p>
    I recommend reviewing their privacy policies:

  <h2>3. Cloudflare CAPTCHA and Security Measures</h2>
  <p>To protect my websites from abuse and malicious traffic, <strong>Cloudflare</strong> may present CAPTCHAs or other security challenges to visitors. These are controlled by Cloudflare and may collect minimal data (e.g., <strong>IP addresses</strong>, <strong>browser information</strong>). I do not have access to the detailed data collected by Cloudflare.</p>
