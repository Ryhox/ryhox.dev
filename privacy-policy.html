  <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>I do not collect or store any personal information on servers.</strong> Any data such as in-game names you enter is saved locally in your browser's <strong>localStorage</strong>. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to me or to any third parties.</p>
  <p><strong>I do not use backend servers or databases</strong> to collect or store personal information.</p>
  <p>My websites <strong>do not use cookies or tracking technologies</strong>.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of DNS and Hosting Services</h2>
  <p>I use <strong>Cloudflare</strong> as my DNS provider and <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> to host my websites. These services may collect limited technical data (such as IP addresses, browser information, etc.) as part of their normal operation, but <strong>I do not have access to any personal data</strong> collected by them.</p>
  <p>
    I recommend reviewing their privacy policies:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cloudflare Privacy Policy</strong></a></li>
      <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GitHub Privacy Policy</strong></a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>3. Cloudflare CAPTCHA and Security Measures</h2>
  <p>To protect my websites from abuse and malicious traffic, <strong>Cloudflare</strong> may present CAPTCHAs or other security challenges to visitors. These are controlled by Cloudflare and may collect minimal data (such as <strong>IP addresses</strong> and <strong>browser information</strong>). I do not have access to the detailed data collected by Cloudflare.</p>
  <p>For more information, please review <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cloudflare’s Privacy Policy</strong></a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Liability Disclaimer:</strong> I am not responsible for Cloudflare's security measures such as CAPTCHAs or bot checks that visitors may encounter. These measures are independently implemented by Cloudflare.</p>

  <h2>4. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
  <p>Since I do not collect or store personal data, <strong>you have full control</strong> over the information saved in your browser.</p>
  <p>You can clear or delete this data at any time through your <strong>browser settings</strong>.</p>

  <h2>5. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
  <p><strong>I am not responsible</strong> for any personal information — such as real names, phone numbers, or other sensitive data — that you may choose to enter in in-game names or other input fields that are saved locally in your browser.</p>

  <p>Some of my websites offer <strong>multiplayer features</strong>. Any in-game names or data you enter in a multiplayer context may be <strong>visible to other players in real time</strong>. Please exercise caution and do not enter sensitive personal information.</p>

  <h2>7. Use of WeatherAPI.com</h2>
  <p>
    My websites may offer weather-related features using the external service <strong>WeatherAPI.com</strong>. When you enter a location (such as a city name or ZIP/postal code), <strong>this data is sent directly to WeatherAPI.com</strong> to retrieve weather information.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do not store or log the locations you enter. The request is made directly from your browser to WeatherAPI.com. Any information returned (such as temperature or weather conditions) is used only to display weather results in the interface.

  <p>My websites may contain links to external websites. I am <strong>not responsible for the privacy practices</strong> of these third-party sites. Please review their privacy policies separately before using them.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
  <p>I take reasonable technical measures to ensure that my websites are secure and free from known vulnerabilities. However, <strong>no website can guarantee 100% security</strong>. I recommend using caution when using any online service.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are encouraged to review it periodically. <strong>Changes will become effective immediately upon posting</strong> on this page.</p>
